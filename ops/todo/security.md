# Security

Security is more of a never ending wish list than anything else.

Here in no particular order is a list of things that could benefit security:

- [ ] Check all remote ssh scripts againt some sort of hash that represents the integrity of the original file.
- [ ] Decide if gettting 'formula' from GitHub via Salt's `git_fs` via http without checking sums is safe.
